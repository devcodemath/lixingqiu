Set example
To create a set, we use the set() function.
 
If we add the same item element multiple times, they are removed.  A set may not contain the same element multiple times.

In this class, you¡¯ll discover what a Python Set is, what can you do with it and how to use it in programs. Moreover, you¡¯ll essentially learn how to create a Set, add/remove elements in it and all other operations that you can execute using Sets in Python.

How To Instantiate A Set In Python?
You can invoke any of the following two methods to create a Python Set.

If you have a fixed set of elements, then group them using a comma as the separator and enclose the group inside curly braces.
Another way is to call the built-in ¡°set()¡± method which can also be used to add elements at run-time.
Also, remember, the elements can be of any types such as an integer, a float, a tuple, or strings, etc. The only exception with a Set is that it can¡¯t store a mutable item such as a list, a set or a dictionary.
